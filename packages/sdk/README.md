The current SDK scope cover the following features:

1. Create embedded / smart wallets
2. Top up a wallet with test tokens
3. Earn yield using tokens (TBD)

Current SDK is an NPM library, but it already could be used as a local library in `package/frontend`

## Requirements

2. node >= 22.11.0

When an SDK is built, then it could be used in package/frontend
