## Vercel deployment

To deploy a demo frontend on Vercel with a local network you need to:

1. Have a running public Anvil Fork that can be accessed from web. Check [the `packages/blockchain` README.md](https://github.com/0xdeval/mycelium-sdk/blob/main/packages/blockchain/README.md) for more context about Anvil Fork
2. Have a running public Bundler that can be accessed from web. Check [the `packages/blockchain` README.md](https://github.com/0xdeval/mycelium-sdk/blob/main/packages/blockchain/README.md) for more context about Alto Bundler
3. Have a running blockchain service from `packages/blockchain` that can be accessed from web

Right after all 3 components are available you can deploy `packages/frontend`:

- Install vercel: `pnpm install -g vercel`
- Make sure your on root folder
- Deploy frontend: `pnpm run deploy`
- On Vercel "Build and Deployment" settings set the following "Root Directory" - `packages/frontend`
